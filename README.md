# DSA Project 3

hello!!

Helpful links:
I think this is the API request we need for this project: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-person

For the visual representation, it should be pretty simple no?
We need a way for the user to type two names and a button to submit it. It should be doable? 
The biggest issue that I can think right now is validating user input... I'm not really sure on how the parsing right now handles that..
